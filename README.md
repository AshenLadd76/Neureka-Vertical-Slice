\# Neureka Vertical App Slice



This repository contains a \*\*vertical slice\*\* of the original app, built to explore fast, maintainable delivery of dynamic, data-driven content in Unity.



The slice demonstrates modular architecture, event-driven systems, and data ingestion from JSON/CSV files, making content updates accessible to non-technical users while remaining easy for developers to extend.



It also experiments with \*\*Unity UI Toolkit\*\* to evaluate code-driven UI versus UXML and traditional workflows.
