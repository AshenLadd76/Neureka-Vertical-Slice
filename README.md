\# Neureka Vertical Slice



\## This repository contains a Unity app slice built to explore fast, maintainable delivery of dynamic, data-driven content in a production-style environment.



The slice focuses on enabling non-technical users to add and update assessments and questionnaires via JSON and CSV files, while remaining easy for developers to extend through modular, self-contained systems.



It also serves as an experiment in using Unity UI Toolkit for rapid UI construction, favouring code-driven UI and self-managed modules over UXML and tightly coupled lifecycle patterns.
