# Neureka Vertical Slice

The original Neureka App was designed to gamify interactive cognitive assessments and collect data using questionnaires and tasks. The app's purpose is to collect data that is used to further research 
into Dementia and mental health.

This vertical slice demonstrates how modular architecture and dynamic content generation can make an app easy to extend for developers and simple to update for non-technical users.
