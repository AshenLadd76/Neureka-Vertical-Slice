      Did you know that being more
      physically active reduces risk of developing Dementia?



      The goal of
      this study is to understand why this is the case - to link together lots of
      pieces of data to help us unpack the complex relationship between mind, body
      and environment so we can figure out new ways to harness it in the fight against
      dementia'
