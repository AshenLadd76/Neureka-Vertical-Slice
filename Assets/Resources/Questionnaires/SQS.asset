    questionnaireIntroduction: "The Sleep Questionnaire (SQS) is a standardized assessment
      tool designed to evaluate sleep patterns, quality, and disturbances. \r\n\r\nIt
      gathers self-reported data on aspects such as bedtime routines, sleep duration,
      night-time awakenings, and subjective sleep quality. The questionnaire helps
      identify potential sleep issues and supports research or clinical decision-making
      in sleep health."
